Over the past fifteen years we have developed Koopmans functionals, a computationally efficient approach for predicting spectral properties in a functional framework [1]. These orbital-density-dependent functionals impose a generalized piecewise linearity condition that ensures that orbital energies match the corresponding electron removal/addition total energy differences (in contrast to semi-local DFT, where a mismatch between the two lies at the heart of the band gap problem and the unreliability of Kohn-Sham band structures more generally). Koopmans functionals prove to be very powerful, yielding band structures and molecular orbital energies and with comparable accuracy to self-consistent GW approaches but at greatly reduced computational cost and complexity [2]. This talk will cover the theory of Koopmans functionals and how recent developments -- namely, the development of automated workflows via the \texttt{koopmans} code [3] and projectability-based Wannierization [4] -- have brought us one step closer to black-box prediction of accurate band structures.
